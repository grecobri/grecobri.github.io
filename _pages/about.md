About Me
------

Hi, I'm Brian Greco, a first-year Statistics PhD student at Notre Dame's <a href ="https://acms.nd.edu">Department of Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics</a>.  I previously received my BA in Mathematics from Grinnell College and my MS in Biostatistics from the University of Michigan, along with doing research in statistical genetics at Dordt College.  Before my PhD, I worked as a data scientist at Google.

My research interests center around foundational questions in data analysis: how can we use statistics in a way that is privacy-preserving, fair, and honest?  When not thinking about statistics, I like watching football and learning French.
