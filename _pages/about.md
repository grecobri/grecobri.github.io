About Me
------

Hi, I'm Brian Greco, a first-year Statistics PhD student at Notre Dame's <a href ="https://acms.nd.edu">Department of Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics</a> advised by <a href = "https://sites.google.com/site/stefanocastrucciowebsite/">Stefano Castruccio</a>.  I previously earned my BA in Mathematics from Grinnell College and my MS in Biostatistics from the University of Michigan, and did research in statistical genetics at Dordt College.  Before coming to Notre Dame, I also worked as a data scientist at Google.  When not thinking about statistics, I like watching football and learning French.
